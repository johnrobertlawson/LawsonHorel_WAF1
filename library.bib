@article{Zahn2010,
abstract = {Every winter, the high-latitude oceans are struck by severe storms that are considerably smaller than the weather-dominating synoptic depressions. Accompanied by strong winds and heavy precipitation, these often explosively developing mesoscale cyclones-termed polar lows-constitute a threat to offshore activities such as shipping or oil and gas exploitation. Yet owing to their small scale, polar lows are poorly represented in the observational and global reanalysis data often used for climatological investigations of atmospheric features and cannot be assessed in coarse-resolution global simulations of possible future climates. Here we show that in a future anthropogenically warmed climate, the frequency of polar lows is projected to decline. We used a series of regional climate model simulations to downscale a set of global climate change scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change. In this process, we first simulated the formation of polar low systems in the North Atlantic and then counted the individual cases. A previous study using NCEP/NCAR re-analysis data revealed that polar low frequency from 1948 to 2005 did not systematically change. Now, in projections for the end of the twenty-first century, we found a significantly lower number of polar lows and a northward shift of their mean genesis region in response to elevated atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration. This change can be related to changes in the North Atlantic sea surface temperature and mid-troposphere temperature; the latter is found to rise faster than the former so that the resulting stability is increased, hindering the formation or intensification of polar lows. Our results provide a rare example of a climate change effect in which a type of extreme weather is likely to decrease, rather than increase.},

abstract = {Although skills are not considered relevant in chance-governed activities, only a few studies have assessed the extent to which sport expert skills in wagering are a manifestation of the illusion of control. This study examined (a) whether expert hockey bettors could make better predictions than chance, (b) whether expert hockey bettors could achieve greater monetary gains than chance, and (c) what kind of strategies hockey gamblers rely on when betting. Accordingly, 30 participants were asked to report their state lottery hockey bets on 6 occasions. We suggest that the information used by bettors, along with near-misses, reinforces their perception of expertise. The results of this experiment suggest that the so-called "skills" of the sports bettors are cognitive distortions.},

Spectral, wavelet, and structure function analyses performed with the 25-Hz in situ data are used to investigate the relationship between gravity waves and turbulence. Mesoscale dynamics are analyzed with the 20-km hydrostatic Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) model and a nested 1-km simulation with the nonhydrostatic Clark–Hall (CH) cloud-scale model. Turbulence occurred in association with a wide spectrum of upward propagating gravity waves above the jet core. Inertia–gravity waves were generated within a region of unbalanced frontogenesis in the vicinity of a complex tropopause fold. Turbulent kinetic energy fields forecast by the RUC and CH models displayed a strongly banded appeara...},

@article{Haugen1971,
annote = {Motivation:
- Experimental data for analysing a constant flux layer or turbulent transport are lacking
- This paper shows experiments that act to plug this gap

        
Experiment:
- Set in summer, in SW KS with very little topographical variation, and as close to horizontal homogeneity as you can get in terms of topography
- Not the case in ground cover, as wheat stubble and bare ground is alternated year-by-year for agricultural reasons
- Some areas are irrigated and therefore have growing crop in warmer months, with subsequent high latent heat fluxes
- 32m tower over winter wheat only (0.18m high)
- 2.4 km of uniform fetch in prevailing wind direction, typically southerly wind. Obs limited to wind with southerly component

        
Equipment:
- Turbulent velocity pertubations measured with 3-component pulse-type sonic anemometers. 5.6, 11.3, 22.6m levels.
- Temperature fluctuations measured with 25um diameter platinum thermo. 
- As long as wind did not change from 45º from prevailing wind direction to avoid flow disruption from the probe structure
- Wheat stubble was tall for 1m diameter drag plate.
- Replanting drag plate area was difficult to do uniformly, and overplanting of stubble caused problems...(see later)
- Drag plate response very sensitive to height of stubble
- When drag plates agreed with each other (after independent installation), confidence was placed in data

        
Data:
- 24 one-hour experiments
- Sonic anemometers, PRTs, drag plates at 20 Hz, filtered to 10, 10, and 5 Hz respectively to avoid 'aliasing effects', i.e. samples being indistinguisable from each other. Like filming a car wheel with a slow frame rate.
- Drag plates needed no-wind checks at 15 min intervals. If drag plate shifted 2.5\% of measured u*, data was rejected
- 11.3m momentum flux data was removed due to electrical errors
- Variation in air density ignored for u*
- Ri number computed from profile data by diff. curves fitted to wind speed at 5 points - is this enough?

        
Results
- Large variability in momentum flux for unstable conditions
	- Suggests sub-meso circulations
	- This means the mean vertical gradient is uncertain
- Heat flux more stable -> vertical gradient constant
- When U 22.6 > 6m/s, large downward momentum fluxes occur every 10-20 min at all levels; always accompanied by upward temperature flux
	- This is an upward transport of lower momentum
- Stress increases with height sharply; decreases at drag plate
- Stress gradient reverses in quiet periods
- Longer averaging time, net momentum flux is constant with height
- Evidence suggests horizontal roll vortices - convergent parts of rolls cause the bursts (to resolve this you'd need some more sensors...)
- When winds are weak, and it is unstable, momentum flux upwards reverse the flux estimate for 15 minute periods.
- All large disturbances increase in intensity with height, moreso with momentum and less so with heat.

        
Variation with height
- Stress variation with height about 5m is within observational error ==> constant
- Stress below 5m shows less variability and surface stress higher
- Overestimation of stress due to synthetic nature of drag plate plants. Hence data was extrapolated.
- Heat flux above 5m, instable condirions, was less variable than for stress, and it is constant with height within 20\% up to 22m.
- Neutral to stable shows ratios as very large, nonstationary
- With increasing instability, wT strong covariance, uw very low
- Drag plate u* is better for estimates of dependent parameters than local u*

        
Conclusions
- The lowest 23m are constant within 20\%, as long as sufficient averaging time is chosen to let negative and positive fluxes cancel
- Downward bursts associated with high wind speed - convergent horizontal rolls?
- Bursts with low speed are result of rotating systems such as thermals and dust devils
- Drag plates give best results for larger height/diameter ratios (however they also have the strange errors associated with replanting the stubble...)
- w correlated well with T and not u. uw especially bad in unstable conditions

abstract = {Abstract The three-dimensional structure of wave propagation and breaking on the edge of polar vortices is examined using a multilayer quasigeostrophic model, with piecewise constant potential vorticity (PV) in each layer. The linear propagation of waves up the edge of a vortex is found to be sensitive to vertical variations in the vortex structure, with reduced propagation if the PV or area of the vortex increases with height; this reduction is dramatic for a cylindrical vortex with increasing PV. The characteristics of the nonlinear evolution and wave breaking is examined using high-resolution contour dynamics simulations and is also found to be sensitive to the vertical structure of the vortex. The amplitude of the forcing required for wave breaking to occur is larger for baroclinic vortices (with PV or area increasing with height) than for barotropic vortices. For cylindrical vortices with PV increasing with height the variation of wave breaking with forcing amplitude is qualitatively different from t...},

abstract = {The concept of entropy and its relevant principles, mainly the principle of maximum entropy production (MEP), the effect of negative entropy flow (NEF) on the organization of atmospheric systems and the principle of the Second Law of thermodynamics, as well as their applications to atmospheric sciences, are reviewed. 
Some formulations of sub-grid processes such as diffusion parameterization schemes in computational geophysical fluid dynamics that can be improved based on 
full-irreversibility are also discussed, although they have not yet been systematically subjected to scrutiny from the perspective of the entropy budgets. A comparative investigation shows that the principle of MEP applies to the entropy production of macroscopic fluxes and determines the most probable state, that is, a system may choose a development meta-stable trajectory with a smaller production since entropy production behavior involves many specific dynamical and thermodynamic processes in the atmosphere and the extremal principles only provide a general insight into the overall configuration of the atmosphere. In contrast to the principle of MEP, the analysis of NEF is able to provide a new insight into the mechanism responsible for the evolution of a weather system as well as a new approach to predicting its track and intensity trend.},

annote = {- Revealing salt lands increases albedo and lowers temperature, though temperature was already lower in winter due to water's higher heat capacity. Check papers about temperatures, Steenburgh snowstorm climatology?
- What is the prevailing wind in the basin? Higher albedo causes relatively-cooler advection downstream, though weak synoptic current would reverse thermal circulations
- Lower temps decrease certain photochemical reaction rates, temperature-dependent biogenic hydrocarbon emissions, evporative losses of organic compounds, and cooling requirements (hence less emission from power plant). They also decrease the depth of the mixed layer, higher O3 concentrations. (How has the depth of sea breezes changed, is that possible to model, see Crosman paper)
- Sea breeze is weaker is land has higher albedo, and less water, increases O3 aloft.
- Is there a paper that derives albedo changes over the lake area? If not, do it oneself? Brest and Goward 1987.
- Water albedo, around 0.1? Even bare land has higher than that.
- Moderate (15\%) increases in albedo saw a decrease of up to 2ºC; Extreme (30\%) saw up to 4.5.
- Decrease in biogenic hydrocarbons: 7 tons per day or 2\% decrease in case of 15\% increase in albedo. Sounds small but accounted for photochemical simulations in the paper
- Ozone and temperature have relationship via Peroxyacetyl Nitrate (Cardelino and Chameides 1990)
- Taha et al 1994 found temperature always reduced ozone. However, temperature decreases mixed layer, increasing concentratons.
- Note the results are location and date-specific and non-transferable.
- Just because ozone is reduced in one place, its precursors can be transported downwind, or recirculated to upwind location, where they affect ozone.
- High albedo materials are poor reflectors in the UV normally, Berdahl and Bretz (Energy and Buildings special issue on urban heat islands)? Harker et al 1977 says <0.4um has NO2 decrease... how does salt reflect UV?
- Overall, study found 4.7\% decrease in net ozone when albedo increased 30\% (is that everywhere or in certain places?)

abstract = {Theory and modelling predict that hurricane intensity should increase with increasing global mean temperatures, but work on the detection of trends in hurricane activity has focused mostly on their frequency and shows no trend. Here I define an index of the potential destructiveness of hurricanes based on the total dissipation of power, integrated over the lifetime of the cyclone, and show that this index has increased markedly since the mid-1970s. This trend is due to both longer storm lifetimes and greater storm intensities. I find that the record of net hurricane power dissipation is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature, reflecting well-documented climate signals, including multi-decadal oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global warming. My results suggest that future warming may lead to an upward trend in tropical cyclone destructive potential, and--taking into account an increasing coastal population--a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century.},

abstract = {Water is a naturally circulating resource that is constantly recharged. Therefore, even though the stocks of water in natural and artificial reservoirs are helpful to increase the available water resources for human society, the flow of water should be the main focus in water resources assessments. The climate system puts an upper limit on the circulation rate of available renewable freshwater resources (RFWR). Although current global withdrawals are well below the upper limit, more than two billion people live in highly water-stressed areas because of the uneven distribution of RFWR in time and space. Climate change is expected to accelerate water cycles and thereby increase the available RFWR. This would slow down the increase of people living under water stress; however, changes in seasonal patterns and increasing probability of extreme events may offset this effect. Reducing current vulnerability will be the first step to prepare for such anticipated changes.},

abstract = {With the advent of the MST (mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere) radar technique the atmosphere from 0 to 100 km can be observed with a single radar system. Several different mechanisms have been identified as causing the echoes observed by MST radars. Two primary mechanisms are scattering from turbulent irregularities and Fresnel (or partial) reflection from horizontal strata. Two additional mechanisms that apply primarily to the upper mesosphere are meteor scatter and thermal (or incoherent or Thomson) scatter. Below the stratopause the refractive index structure responsible for the echoes arises solely from neutral atmosphere fluctuations; above the stratopause the radar cross section of such fluctuations is enhanced by the presence of free electrons (moreover, in the absence of small-scale neutral fluctuations the electrons alone can provide the scattered signal). This paper is an attempt to unify the scattering and reflection theories in the light of observational studies.},

abstract = {Abstract A mesoscale-model simulation is used to examine the evolution of the cold front and accompanying cloud bands in eastern Mexico associated with Superstorm 1993 (12–14 March). The simulated cold front differed in structure and evolution from a classical cold front, in agreement with evidence from observations and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses. The surface cold front, as defined by the leading edge of strong northerlies and cold advection, initially possessed a rearward tilt with height over southern Texas. Within 6 h, the leading edge of the front moved equatorward and developed a large-scale forward tilt of greater than 200 km in the horizontal from the surface to 700 hPa. This forward tilt occurred as a mid- to upper-tropospheric baroclinic zone arrived from over the Sierra Madre, descended into eastern Mexico, and interacted with the surface cold front. Embedded within this large-scale forward tilt was a locally enhanced horizontal potential temperature gradient tha...},

This contribution is based primarily on data from a six-member ensemble of 45-yr climate runs, each of which is forced by observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea-ice extents and are unique only in their initial atmospheric conditions. The potentially predictable component of atmospheric interannual variability is assumed to be that due to oceanic forcing, and using “analysis of variance,” this is separated from the unpredictable internal component; potential predictability is measured as the ratio of ocean-forced variance to total variance. Significance levels and confidence intervals are calculated, both of which are essential for a meaningful interpretation of predictability estimates; the latter show there is low susceptibility to sampling problems here because of the large data source available. Global maps of potential predictability, for simulated seasonal mean prec...},

abstract = {Abstract This work describes the dynamics of adjoint sensitivity perturbations that excite block onsets over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Appropriate functions are derived for the blocking indices for these two regions and the model basic flow is constructed from Northern Hemisphere climatological data. The concepts of sensitivity analysis are extended to forced problems. This tool is used to investigate block onset due to atmospheric forcing, such as that resulting from tropical sea surface temperature anomalies. These linear studies are carried out in a hemispherical, primitive equations, $\theta$-coordinate, two-layer model. Results show that wind sensitivity perturbations less than 10 m s−1 and sensitivity forcing of vorticity sources of the order of 1.5 × 10−10 s−2 are sufficient to excite block onset. Both for the Pacific and Atlantic blocking, sensitivity perturbations and forcing perturbations, when expressed in terms of vertical vorticity, display a Rossby wave train structure mainly found on the so...},

The main aim here is to advocate and demonstrate an approach to skill and reproducibility based on spatial anomaly patterns. Benefits and applications of this type of analysis include the efficient extraction of the model’s forced variability, guidance on systematic errors in the model’s response to SST forcing, clues to physical mechanisms, and a basis for model output statistics for seasonal forecasting. Some of the possible statistical techniques are illustrated, though the aim is not to provide an exhaustive comparison of the different spatial analysis techniques available. The examples are taken from an ensemble of three GCM integrations forced with observed SST through 1979–88. Boreal summer examples are given for the tropical Pacific and Europe, providing a contrast of a high and a low skill situation, respectively. For model verification, a coupled...},

@article{Woollings2008,
abstract = {Abstract This paper proposes the hypothesis that the low-frequency variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) arises as a result of variations in the occurrence of upper-level Rossby wave–breaking events over the North Atlantic. These events lead to synoptic situations similar to midlatitude blocking that are referred to as high-latitude blocking episodes. A positive NAO is envisaged as being a description of periods in which these episodes are infrequent and can be considered as a basic, unblocked situation. A negative NAO is a description of periods in which episodes occur frequently. A similar, but weaker, relationship exists between wave breaking over the Pacific and the west Pacific pattern. Evidence is given to support this hypothesis by using a two-dimensional potential-vorticity-based index to identify wave breaking at various latitudes. This is applied to Northern Hemisphere winter data from the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40), and the events identified are then related to the NAO. Cert...},

@article{Eisenhardt1989,
abstract = {This paper describes the process of inducting theory using case studies-from specifying the research questions to reaching closure. Some features of the process, such as problem definition and construct validation, are similar to hypothesis-testing research. Others, such as within-case analysis and replication logic, are unique to the inductive, case-oriented process. Overall, the process described here is highly iterative and tightly linked to data. This research approach is especially appropriate in new topic areas. The resultant theory is often novel, testable, and empirically valid. Finally, framebreaking insights, the tests of good theory (e.g., parsimony, logical coherence), and convincing grounding in the evidence are the key criteria for evaluating this type of research.},

abstract = {Synoptic, coarse-grain, isentropic maps of Ertel's potential vorticity Q for the northern middle stratosphere, estimated using a large-Richardson-number approximation, are presented for a number of days in January–February 1979, together with some related isentropic trajectory calculations The effects of substituting FGGE for NMC base data are noted, as well as some slight corrections to maps published earlier. The combined evidence from the observations and from dynamical models strongly indicates the existence of planetary-wave breaking, a process in which material contours are rapidly and irreversibly deformed. In the winter stratosphere this occurs most spectacularly in a gigantic ‘nonlinear critical layer’, or ‘surfzone’, which surrounds the main polar vortex, and which tends to erode the vortex when wave amplitudes become large. Some of the FGGE-based Q maps suggest that we may be seeing glimpses of local dynamical instabilities and vortex-rollup phenomena within breaking planetary waves. Related phenomena in the troposphere are discussed. An objective definition of the area A(t) of the main vortex, as it appears on isentropic Q maps, is proposed. A smoothed time series of daily values of A(t) should be a statistically powerful ‘circulation index’ for the state of the winter-time middle stratosphere, which avoids the loss of information incurred by Eulerian space and time averaging.},

Eventually, perhaps, a great deal: the overall climate response to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases may prove much simpler and more predictable than the chaos of short-term weather. Quantifying the diversity of possible responses is essential for any objective, probability-based climate forecast, and this task will require a new generation of climate modelling experiments, systematically exploring the range of model behaviour that is consistent with observations. It will be substantially harder to quantify the range of possible changes in the hydrologic cycle than in global-mean temperature, both because the observations are less complete and because the physical constraints are weaker.},

@article{Kurakin2011,
abstract = {A universal discovery method potentially applicable to all disciplines studying organizational phenomena has been developed. This method takes advantage of a new form of global symmetry, namely, scale-invariance of self-organizational dynamics of energy/matter at all levels of organizational hierarchy, from elementary particles through cells and organisms to the Universe as a whole. The method is based on an alternative conceptualization of physical reality postulating that the energy/matter comprising the Universe is far from equilibrium, that it exists as a flow, and that it develops via self-organization in accordance with the empirical laws of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. It is postulated that the energy/matter flowing through and comprising the Universe evolves as a multiscale, self-similar structure-process, i.e., as a self-organizing fractal. This means that certain organizational structures and processes are scale-invariant and are reproduced at all levels of the organizational hierarchy. Being a form of symmetry, scale-invariance naturally lends itself to a new discovery method that allows for the deduction of missing information by comparing scale-invariant organizational patterns across different levels of the organizational hierarchy.An application of the new discovery method to life sciences reveals that moving electrons represent a keystone physical force (flux) that powers, animates, informs, and binds all living structures-processes into a planetary-wide, multiscale system of electron flow/circulation, and that all living organisms and their larger-scale organizations emerge to function as electron transport networks that are supported by and, at the same time, support the flow of electrons down the Earth's redox gradient maintained along the core-mantle-crust-ocean-atmosphere axis of the planet. The presented findings lead to a radically new perspective on the nature and origin of life, suggesting that living matter is an organizational state/phase of nonliving matter and a natural consequence of the evolution and self-organization of nonliving matter.The presented paradigm opens doors for explosive advances in many disciplines, by uniting them within a single conceptual framework and providing a discovery method that allows for the systematic generation of knowledge through comparison and complementation of empirical data across different sciences and disciplines.},

@article{Gage1981,
abstract = {In recent years several groups using VHF radars have reported highly anisotropic echoes originating from stable regions of the troposphere and stratosphere. The echoes are most intense looking vertically, and their occurrence is well correlated with regions of hydrostatic stability. Observations also show that the echoes are usually much stronger when observed with coarse spatial resolution. There is no commonly used scattering or reflection model that can account for these features. In this paper we present a new model to explain the enhanced vertical echoes. The model pertains to scattering from the half-wavelength Fourier component of horizontally coherent fine structure in the radio refractive index within a region of finite vertical extent. We refer to this echoing mechanism as \&\#8216;Fresnel scattering.\&\#8217; The new model is applied to simulate the magnitude of VHF radar echoes by using radiosonde temperature soundings as input. Good agreement is found between these simulations and observations at the Sunset VHF radar in Colorado.},

@article{Elsner2008,
abstract = {Atlantic tropical cyclones are getting stronger on average, with a 30-year trend that has been related to an increase in ocean temperatures over the Atlantic Ocean and elsewhere. Over the rest of the tropics, however, possible trends in tropical cyclone intensity are less obvious, owing to the unreliability and incompleteness of the observational record and to a restricted focus, in previous trend analyses, on changes in average intensity. Here we overcome these two limitations by examining trends in the upper quantiles of per-cyclone maximum wind speeds (that is, the maximum intensities that cyclones achieve during their lifetimes), estimated from homogeneous data derived from an archive of satellite records. We find significant upward trends for wind speed quantiles above the 70th percentile, with trends as high as 0.3 +/- 0.09 m s(-1) yr(-1) (s.e.) for the strongest cyclones. We note separate upward trends in the estimated lifetime-maximum wind speeds of the very strongest tropical cyclones (99th percentile) over each ocean basin, with the largest increase at this quantile occurring over the North Atlantic, although not all basins show statistically significant increases. Our results are qualitatively consistent with the hypothesis that as the seas warm, the ocean has more energy to convert to tropical cyclone wind.},

abstract = {Abstract Virtually all investigations of transient-eddy effects on the large-scale mean vorticity start from the premise that only the rotational transient motion need be considered. In this paper, the seasonal mean vorticity balance at 250 mb is examined, with particular emphasis on those transient term that are associated with the horizontally divergent transient motion. The largest transient terms are, in fact, found to be the advection of vorticity by the divergent flow and the stretching term. These am only a factor of 2 smaller than the mean flow terms. However, these transient term have a strong mutual cancellation. Their residual, the convergence of the vorticity flux associated with the divergent motion, although much smaller, is comparable on the planetary scale with the similar term associated with the rotational motion. These properties are interpreted using simple models. It is concluded that a representation of the vorticity flux by the transient divergent flow may be necessary in an accurat...},

@article{Pentland1984,
abstract = {This paper addresses the problems of 1) representing natural shapes such as mountains, trees, and clouds, and 2) computing their description from image data. To solve these problems, we must be able to relate natural surfaces to their images; this requires a good model of natural surface shapes. Fractal functions are a good choice for modeling 3-D natural surfaces because 1) many physical processes produce a fractal surface shape, 2) fractals are widely used as a graphics tool for generating natural-looking shapes, and 3) a survey of natural imagery has shown that the 3-D fractal surface model, transformed by the image formation process, furnishes an accurate description of both textured and shaded image regions. The 3-D fractal model provides a characterization of 3-D surfaces and their images for which the appropriateness of the model is verifiable. Furthermore, this characterization is stable over transformations of scale and linear transforms of intensity. The 3-D fractal model has been successfully applied to the problems of 1) texture segmentation and classification, 2) estimation of 3-D shape information, and 3) distinguishing between perceptually ``smooth'' and perceptually ``textured'' surfaces in the scene.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

@article{Brayshaw2009,
annote = {Intro
- Latitudinal position of the jet related to subtropical jet and polar front, and to baroclinicity with them
- Storm track related to:	
	Extra-tropical land-sea contrast
	Tropical surface anomalies (T? z?)
	Orography
	Extratropical SST anomalies
Land-sea contrast:
	Winter sees stronger meridional ST gradients due to differential insolation and no horizontal heat transport, and strong zonal gradient due to cold continents and warm seas
	Affect baroclinicity and storm track
Orography:
	If theta perturbation from meridional deflection is less than vertical variation in theta, then horizontal deflection dominates
- "Stationary wave model" linearises the primitive equations around e.g. zonal mean flow for NH winter. Anomalies are introduced and response diagnosed. Problems:
	1. Imposed heating prescribes rather than predicts storm tracks
	2. No clear relationship between heating fields and surface features
	3. Nonlinear feedbacks not included, important for heating through orography.
- GCM experiments finding responses to boundary conditions (BCs):
	1. sensitivity to features with realistic, complete lower BCs, has complicated bkground state
	2. Highly idealised BCs with aquaplanet, hard to relate to real world

        
> This paper forms a bridge between these approaches. Model is full GCM, runs as symmetric aquaplanet, then increases lower BCs to replicate orography and SSTs.

        
CONCLUSIONS
- Tropical landmasses produce response similar to weaker SST anomalies. Increased ascent and divergent upper-trop flow over landmass. 
- Extratropical landmasses lead to suppressed storm track in interior due to surface drag and less moisture. High H fluxes over equatorward portion leads to baroclinicity over continent. With confluence on east coast, baroclinity extends over downstream ocean and cyclogenesis ensues
- Rocky Mountain-style orography has strongest effect on flow. Anticyclogenesis in poleward part of mountain, where flow goes over mountain; cyclogenesis in equatorside, where flow is blocked or goes around above 800 hPa. Strong SW-NE tilt to jet and storm track on lee side.
- The SW-NE tilt of the US coastline unable to reproduce SW-NE tilt seen in real NAtl storm track
- Subtropical edge of Eurasia distorts downward Hadley cell branch, shifting subtropical jet south and split-jet over Eurasia. Similar, but weaker, over Mexico. AREA OF RESEARCH
- Northern half of Rockies deepens cold pool in NE of NAmerica, enhancing baroclinicity. Land-sea contrast in lee of NAmerica continent shapes storm track more with orography.
- Ideal, equinox model shows importance of Rockies to generate stationary waves that enhance temp diff between east and west coasts of NAtlantic. Even stronger with winter westerly flow and greater land-sea contrast.

abstract = {Abstract Forecasters often develop rules of thumb for adjusting model guidance. Ideally, before use, these rules of thumb should be validated through a careful comparison of model forecasts and observations over a large sample. Practically, such evaluation studies are difficult to perform because forecast models are continually being changed, and a hypothesized rule of thumb may only be applicable to a particular forecast model configuration. A particular rule of thumb was examined here: dprog/dt. Given a set of lagged forecasts from the same model all verifying at the same time, this rule of thumb suggests that if the forecasts show a trend, this trend is more likely than not to continue and thus provide useful information for correcting the most recent forecast. Forecasters may also note the amount of continuity of forecasts to estimate the magnitude of the error in the most recent forecast. Statistical evaluation of this rule of thumb was made possible here using a dataset of forecasts from a “frozen” ...},

A large increase was seen in the number and proportion of hurricanes reaching categories 4 and 5. The largest increase occurred in the North Pacific, Indian, and Southwest Pacific Oceans, and the smallest percentage increase occurred in the North Atlantic Ocean. These increases have taken place while the number of cyclones and cyclone days has decreased in all basins except the North Atlantic during the past decade.},

annote = {Key factors when looking at sea breezes and pollution transport: Diurnal-varying flows; daytime strong mixing; thermal internal boundary layer near coast; stable marine layer; nighttime shallow land-breeze with weak mixing. 
- Combined effects of sea breeze and valley winds in Kurita et al 1985
- Nighttime winds are weaker (downslope and landbreeze), but I think not, see Morgan's jet paper

        
          
Section 3
        
- 3am local time, pollution in mountain wind area at 20m transported downvalley. Horizontal wind shear disperses pollution. In this case, no jets appeared. Morgan's research - even more horizontal shear. Dispersion hence is problem for Lagrangian transport models.
- 12pm local time, pollution released in sea breeze area near shore 20m. Not much dispersion when advected into valley
          
NO2 advection in model
        
- Location near sea is polluted in early morning due to land breeze (nocturnal boundary layer keeps pollutants trapped, combined land/mountain breeze advects pollution to coast). It is clean during afternoon and evening due to the sea breeze advecting clean air from sea.
- Pollution near mountain was high during the afternoon, higher than any other site. Due to long fetch over emission area when valley/sea breeze starts. Clean in evening due to downslope, advection from non-emission area. Presumably, also high due to confined valley funnelling pollution
-Midplain saw little diurnal change, maintained high.

        Using HNO3 – produced by reactions, useful as tracer
        
Peak of HNO3 moved inland around 2ms-1, close to speed of SBF. Peak value is higher at inland site, showing air mass that originated from the sea, travels over emission zones and accumlates HNO3 within mass. Accelerates due to valley wind.
          
SO2 - from power plants burning coal and heavy oil
        

        Conclusion:
-Here, land and mountain breezes do not merge. Do they in SLC? In this case, it creates a weak-wind area.
- Don't forget, land/mountain wind is shallower, due to temperatures (mixed layers)?
- In land breeze, some pollution returned to its starting point after 12 hours.
- Land breeze maximum just before sunrise due to radiative cooling of land, causes NO2 increase at coast, and O3 decrease. (due to no light, temperatures, or a reaction?)
- O3 is consumed by emitted NO in sea-breeze regime.

abstract = {Abstract The behavior of an isolated vortex perturbed by topographically forced Rossby waves is studied using the method of Contour Dynamics. For a single-contour vortex a distinct forcing threshold exists above which the wave breaks in a dynamically significant way, leading to a disruption of the vortex. This breaking is distinguished from the process of weak filamentary breaking described by Dritschel and classified here as microbreaking; the latter occurs in nondivergent flow even at very small forcing amplitudes but does not affect the vortex in a substantial manner. In cases with finite Rossby deformation radius (comparable with the vortex radius) neither breaking nor microbreaking occurs below the forcing threshold. In common with previous studies using high-resolution spectral models, the vortex is not diluted by intrusion of outside air, except during remerger with a secondary vortex shed previously from the main vortex during a breaking event. The kinematics of the breaking process and of the vor...},

In this paper, however, the emphasis will be on scale-invariant (fractal) symmetries. The earth's topography is an example of both statistically self-similar and self-affine fractals. Landforms are also associated with drainage networks, which are statistical fractal trees. A universal feature of drainage networks and other growth networks is side branching. Deterministic space-filling networks with side-branching symmetries are illustrated. It is shown that naturally occurring drainage networks have symmetries similar to diffusion-limited aggregation clusters.},

annote = {"higher albedo, thermal conductivity, and moisture content than does the surrounding desert." – latent heat takes even more energy from H. High water table with playas

        
Replace salt bed with 'playa', spanish for beach

        
Higher thermal-conductivity, compact substrate

        
Albedo can vary strongly with rain

        
Salt reduces vegetation and hence transpiration; surrounding desert also has plants, transpiration.

        
Tapper (1991) found salt lake sediment had order of magnitude larger thermal conductivity larger vs surrounding sand. Depth of daytime breeze around 250m, 100m at night

        
Tapper (1988, 1991) shows the dominant daytime effect of the lake to be a large subsidence region downwind of the lake, bordered laterally by zones of upward motion. Vertical velocity in the ascent and descent regions exceeded 20 cm s-1. Based on sensitivity studies, they concluded that the salt-breeze circulation could be attributed mainly to the difference in albedo between the playa and surrounding desert rather than to differences in soil thermal properties.

        
Davis et al. (1999), in the context of a description ofthe overall performance of an operational mesogamma- scale model for the area of the Great Salt Lake Desert studied here, showed a sample forecast of a salt breeze

        
Roughness length of playa 0.01m, surrounding shrubland 0.11m

        
Figure 16 shows good figure

        
Fig 21 shows PBL reduces by 2 km in sensitivity analysis, no playa.

        
Sensitivity studies show lake breeze and downslope combine, hard to differentiate.

        
Low-level cold advection and subsidence behind LBF can reduce PBL in late afternoon by 2.5 km (but no reference to IBL, this 'difference field' is not shown and could be the model measuring top of density current from lake)

        
Playa breeze of 3-4 m/s during day and night

-Differing scales mean Coriolis effect is negligible within horizontal ranges of a few km or less. Height scale is 1 km (PBL).
- Question: What are the parameters controlling the transition between processes driving land/sea breezes and inland breezes?
        
- A striped heteorogeneity only influences breeze dynamics if its horizontal scale is smaller than horizonal scale of the sea-breeze cell i.e. the Rossby radius. Friction not important but horizontal diffusion is, when heterogeneities have scale near PBL depth (also non-hydrostatic).
- What about when the scale of heterogeneity is smaller than Rossby radius but larger than PBL depth, i.e. near-hydrostatic. As Ro radius is 100x the PBL depth, this is a big range.
- Finding: that when horizontal scale \~{} few tens of horizontal scale, frictional effects are considered. Horizontal diffusion only relevant when horizontal scales are less than or equal to boundary layer height.
